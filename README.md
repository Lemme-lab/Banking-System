# Banking Interface/Storage System

## Idea:
The Idea was to create a small Banking System with an non non volatile memory management that is able to be controlled over the terminal. The challenge was to get back into C++ after a long time. 

## Code:
The code is divided into 7 methods which are all called in the main method. 
- interface()
- Add_Record()
- Show_Record()
- Search_Record()
- Show_All()
- Edit_Record()
- Delete_Record()


## Features:
